# Pure CSS3 Buttons

These are just some buttons I made for one of my friends a while ago to launch as a [freebie](http://simplypixels.net/pure-css3-buttons/) on his website, [Simply Pixels](http://simplypixels.net/). A few things about them:

- While they're made in pure CSS, they have fixed widths. The next release should fix this, but for now you need to change width manually to accomodate your needs. 
- The CSS is organized by color (e.g the blue button has an id of blue, etc.) Everything's in style.css. 

By putting these up on GitHub, I get to track the code and make changes to it a little easier. So better stuff will come.

Enjoy!
